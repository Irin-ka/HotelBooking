# HotelBooking

This project was an assignment for the seminar .NET Development Academy by CollegeLink. The seminar lasted three weeks and covered every aspect of web development(front and back end).

The requirement was to build a hotel room booking web app using ASP.NET Core MVC within the seminar period.
Starting this course, I had zero experience in web apps, both front-end and back-end but I learned a lot while creating the project.

The app utilizes :

Front-end:
HTLM5 
CSS3
Bootstrap4
Jquery
JqueryUI
Razor View Engine

Back-end:
Entity framework using a db-first approach.
Microsoft's built-in Dependency Injection framework.
Microsoft's Identity framework.
Several parts of the .NET library.
